# PaFiFA

## Required Software 
* FFMPEG - [sudo apt-get install ffmpeg]
* C3D Caffe Build - Facebook's Old 3D Convolution Caffe Build. You need to download and compile it. You also need to compile pycaffe [make pycaffe] [Link: https://github.com/facebook/C3D/tree/249ab8453be4b213e1068412e290b355997b68d2]
